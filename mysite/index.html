            <h1>BOEING TO MOVE 787 PRODUCTION TO SOUTH CAROLINA STARTING MAY 2021</h1>
            

            <p><strong> Boeing </strong> will consolidate <b> all 787 production at its plant </b>in South Carolina starting in mid-2021, the
                company confirmed Thursday. The decision comes following months of deliberation over possible
                consolidation of its two sites—in North Charleston and Everett, Washington—as production falls from the
                current 10 per month to a total of six per month next year. At one time building 14 Dreamliners per
                month, Boeing had seen demand for widebodies fall even before the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, and in
                January announced a rate reduction from 12 to 10 per month. In April, it then changed the rate plan to
                seven per month by 2022 and then in July, when CEO David Calhoun first acknowledged the consolidation
                studies, to six by 2021.</p>

            <p>"The Boeing 787 is the tremendous success it is today thanks to our great teammates in Everett,” said
                Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal. “They helped give birth to an airplane that changed how
                airlines and passengers want to fly. As our customers manage through the unprecedented global pandemic,
                to ensure the long-term success of the 787 program, we are consolidating 787 production in South
                Carolina.</p>

            <p>“Our team in Puget Sound will continue to focus on efficiently building our 737, 747, 767, and 777
                airplane families, and both sites will drive Boeing initiatives to further enhance safety, quality, and
                operational excellence,” added Deal.</p>

            <p>The company began assembling 787-8 and 787-9 airplanes at its Everett site in 2007 and began operations
                at the North Charleston facility as a second final assembly line in 2010. However, Boeing builds only
                the 787-10 in North Charleston—a non-union site. On Thursday the company said production of the smaller
                787 models will continue in Everett until the program moves to the previously announced production rate
                of six airplanes a month in 2021.</p>

            <p>In a statement, Boeing added that the consolidation review examined the effects and benefits to Boeing
                customers, suppliers, employees and the overall health of the production system. The 787 study stands as
                part of an enterprise review underway to reassess all aspects of Boeing's facility footprint,
                organizational structure, portfolio and investment mix, and supply chain health and stability, it noted.
            </p>
            <p>“We recognize that production decisions can impact our teammates, industry, and our community partners,”
                said Deal. “We extensively evaluated every aspect of the program and engaged with our stakeholders on
                how we can best partner moving forward. These efforts will further refine 787 production and enhance the
                airplane's value proposition.”</p>
            <p>Boeing said it continues to assess effects on employment in Everett and Charleston and will communicate
                any changes directly to its employees.</p>
